!! Introduction 

ReStore is a framework for Dolphin Smalltalk and Pharo which enables objects to be stored in and read from relational databases (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL etc.). 

ReStore aims to make relational persistency as simple as possible, creating and maintaining the database structure itself and providing access to stored objects via familiar Smalltalk messages. This allows you to take advantage of the power and flexibility of relational storage with no specialist knowledge beyond the ability to install and configure your chosen database.
